Iâ€™m Jonathan, a computer science student at Georgia Tech and aspiring software engineer. 

I made this site partly to showcase my portfolio and partly on a whim. Maybe you can tell I got 
nostalgic for 2010 when making it (the *Frutiger Aero* aesthetic sparks joy)! 

### About me: 
I used to study physics at the University of North Georgia. I originally intended to transfer 
to Georgia Tech to study electrical engineering via a dual-degree program. However, 
over time I found myself increasingly drawn to programming, so I decided to transfer 
as a computer science major instead. 

So here I am, a busy jacket. Student by day, student by night. Student on the weekends. I also 
like hiking, gardening, drawing, and reading old books ~~, not that I actually do much of those~~. 
One day I will have time for hobbies! But for now, programming and math are my life, and I'm 
quite okay with that.
