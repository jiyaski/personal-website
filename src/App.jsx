      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>I’m Jonathan, a computer science student at Georgia Tech and aspiring software engineer.</p>
      <p>I originally studied physics at University of North Georgia, but the computers spoke to me. 
        “C̸om͂e̴̽ t̚ǭ̷̦̹ t͚͖he̵̡̱͊̃ d͒ar͒k ̷̦͆ͅsi͝d̉e,” they said. “W̷͘e  ̀há̴v̵͓̀e̴̾͜  ̛͕̈̐c̸̼̰̓̎̕ͅo̍͜o̫͎͝ki̊̓e̷͑s̵͕̍,” they said. I couldn’t refuse.</p>
      <p>So here I am. Programmer by day, programmer by night. Math nerd on the weekends. 
        Occasionally I like to hike in the mountains or read old books.</p>
      <p>Anyway, feel free to look around. If you’re a potential employer, check out my résumé or see 
        a list of projects I’ve worked on. My blog contains random thoughts I decided to write down 
        - some applicable to programming and some not.</p>
